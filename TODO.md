# Planned features

## Script manifest

Convert constants variable names into number for making reference to their static value in an array (as their name/value won't change).
This data will be sotred in the "program manifest", which will be created during the parsing process.

## Debug tools

- Make visual flowcharts from code
- Graphical and terminal debugging tools
- Better error handling
